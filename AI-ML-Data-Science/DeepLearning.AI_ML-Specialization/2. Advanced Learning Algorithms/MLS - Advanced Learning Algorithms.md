# Advice for applying machine learning

This week you'll learn best practices for training and evaluating your learning algorithms to improve performance. This will cover a wide range of useful advice about the machine learning lifecycle, tuning your model, and also improving your training data.

### Learning Objectives

------

- Evaluate and then modify your learning algorithm or data to improve your model's performance

- Evaluate your learning algorithm using cross validation and test datasets.

- Diagnose bias and variance in your learning algorithm

- Use regularization to adjust bias and variance in your learning algorithm

- Identify a baseline level of performance for your learning algorithm

- Understand how bias and variance apply to neural networks

- Learn about the iterative loop of Machine Learning Development that's used to update and improve a machine learning model

- Learn to use error analysis to identify the types of errors that a learning algorithm is making

- Learn how to add more training data to improve your model, including data augmentation and data synthesis

- Use transfer learning to improve your model's performance.

- Learn to include fairness and ethics in your machine learning model development

- Measure precision and recall to work with skewed (imbalanced) datasets

  

# Decision Trees



This week, you'll learn about a practical and very commonly used learning algorithm the decision tree. You'll also learn about variations of the decision tree, including random forests and boosted trees (XGBoost).
